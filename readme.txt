This widget shows how well does your uk postcode rank based on a number of criteria such as population, house prices, crime rate, etc.

== Description ==

How Tipsy is Your Town is a fun widget that shows users how tipsy their town is in relation to towns in the surrounding areas based on the number of pubs in each postcode.

The widget also links to a <a href="http://www.gartoo.net/map/North_West_London">heatmap</a> of the user&#39;s city showing the distribution of pubs in the area, which on a national scale have a negative correlation with house prices and crime rate.
